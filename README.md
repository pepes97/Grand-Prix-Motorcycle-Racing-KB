# Motorcycle Racing

An ontology on the domain of grand prix motorcycle racing. I have chosen this domain because, currently, information on it is very scarce and fragmented. The project was developed from scratch using protégé and, in addition, several queries (SPARQL and DL ) were also written to prove the effective functioning of the whole project.

## Software
